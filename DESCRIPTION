Description: scDesign3 is a unified probabilistic framework that generates realistic in silico high-dimensional single-cell omics data of various cell states, including discrete cell types, continuous trajectories, and spatial locations by learning from real datasets. This package provides a convenient one-shot function to simulate new datasets and provide AIC and BIC to help evaluate the "goodness of fit" of the reference dataset.
