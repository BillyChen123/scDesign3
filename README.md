## scDesign3

---

The R package **scDesign3** is an all-in-one single-cell data simulation tool by using reference datasets with different cell states(cell types, trajectories or and spatial coordinates), different modalities(gene expression, chromatin accessibility, protein abundance, methylation,etc), and complex experimental designs. The transparent parameters enable users to alter models as needed; the model evaluation metrics(AIC, BIC) and convenient visualization function help users select proper models.
